# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the **fumadocs-template** repository! We're excited to have you contribute to creating standards and patterns for using [Fumadocs](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs), or adding new features.


To ensure a smooth contribution process for everyone, please follow these guidelines.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the repository's `"dev"` branch to your GitHub account. This creates your own copy of the project where you can make changes.

2. **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine using Git. This allows you to work on the files locally.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fumadocs-template.git
   ```

3. **Set Upstream Remote:** Add the original repository as an upstream remote to your local clone. This helps you to keep your fork up to date.
   ```sh
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/weaponsforge/fumadocs-template-template.git
   ```

## Making Changes

1. **Create a New Branch:** Always work on a new branch for your changes. This keeps your contributions organized and separate from the main branch.
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feat/your-new-feature-name
   ```

2. **Add Your Content:** Make your changes or additions to the project.
   - If you're adding new documentation (MDX) content, ensure it's placed in the correct directory (`/docsapp/content`) and follows the Markdown (MD) syntax.
   - If you're adding new React components or utilities, ensure intuitive file, variables, and TypeScript naming conventions. Furthermore, ensure React best practices to continue promoting well-structured, optimized and easy-to-follow React components.
   - Before commiting your changes, format your code with `"npm run format"`, and ensure all updates pass the `"npm run lint"` script.

3. **Commit Your Changes:** After making your changes, commit them to your branch. Use clear and concise commit messages to describe your updates.
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add a brief description of your changes"
   ```

4. **Keep Your Fork Updated:** Regularly sync your fork's `"dev"` branch with the upstream repository to keep it up to date. This reduces potential merge conflicts.
   ```sh
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout dev
   git merge upstream/dev
   git push origin dev
   ```

## Submitting Contributions

1. **Push Your Changes:** Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
   ```sh
   git push origin feat/your-new-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Go to the original **fumadocs-template** repository on GitHub and create a new pull request. Base your PR on your feature branch and target the `"dev"` branch of the upstream repository.

3. **Describe Your Contribution:** Provide a clear and detailed description of your pull request. Include the purpose of your changes and any other relevant information.

4. **Review and Collaboration:** Once your PR is submitted, the project maintainers will review your contributions. Be open to feedback and be ready to make additional changes if requested.

## Guidelines

1. **Quality:** Ensure your contributions are high quality, with no spelling or grammatical errors.

2. **Relevance:** Content should be relevant to **Fumadocs** documentation and React (Next.js) development using TypeScript.

3. **Working functionality:** For pull requests involving new features or major updates, ensure the changes are fully functional and optimized. Aim to keep PRs within **`~700` lines of code changes**, breaking them into smaller, self-contained parts when possible. PRs exceeding **`~1000+` lines** may be accepted when justified (e.g., major refactors or foundational features).

4. **Respect:** Respect the structure and formatting of the existing project. Follow the standard Bione rules defined in its `docsapp/biome.json` file.

Thank you for contributing to the **fumadocs-template** repository. Your efforts help in making a reusable template with tested and documented patterns for using [Fumadocs](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs).
